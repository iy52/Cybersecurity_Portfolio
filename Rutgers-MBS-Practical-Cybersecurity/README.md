# 🛡️ Practical Cybersecurity Labs – Rutgers MBS

This folder includes all lab work from my graduate-level Practical Cybersecurity course in the Master’s of Business and Science (MBS) program at Rutgers University. These labs cover foundational cybersecurity skills, documented in a way that reflects my learning process, technical growth, and ability to troubleshoot in real environments.

Each unit focuses on a different part of hands-on security: Linux commands, scripting, encryption, network traffic analysis, and more. This portfolio is built with the intention of showing the time and effort I’ve invested—not just the outcomes.

## 🧰 What’s Inside

### 📁 Unit 1: Kali Linux VM Setup
Set up a Kali Linux VM using VirtualBox. Hit some GRUB-related errors and fixed them through proper image extraction and BIOS settings. Basic networking validated using `ping` and `traceroute`.

### 📁 Unit 2: Linux CLI & Network Tools
Used `dig`, `ping`, `tail`, `wget`, and `grep` to explore system behavior and pull down + search through War & Peace. Practiced redirection and basic command chaining.

### 📁 Unit 3: Python + Regex
Wrote Python scripts to parse text for specific patterns (lines starting with “Russia”, email extraction, etc). Also scripted WHOIS lookups using `python-whois`, and made it CLI-interactive.

### 📁 Unit 4: Crypto & Decryption
Decoded a ROT13 message with `tr`, and decrypted a file using OpenSSL and AES-256-CBC. Turns out the final output was a `.jpg` hidden in plain sight.

### 📁 Unit 5: Password Cracking + Recon
Used `adduser`, `unshadow`, and `john` to crack weak passwords on test accounts. Also explored Shodan.io to identify exposed machines and misconfigured services globally.

### 📁 Unit 6: Wireshark Traffic Analysis
Captured and filtered packets based on HTTP traffic. Looked at default protocol coloring (e.g., DCE/RPC = light purple) and built graphs showing traffic over time.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Got comfortable working inside Kali and on the command line
- Wrote real scripts to automate basic tasks
- Practiced decrypting, scanning, cracking, and capturing traffic
- Developed clear documentation for each lab
- Worked through a lot of things the hard way before getting them right

## 📌 Why This Exists

This isn’t a collection of perfect results—it’s meant to show process, persistence, and growth. I’ve intentionally structured this portfolio to reflect the kind of technical curiosity and follow-through that I bring to real work.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my work.
